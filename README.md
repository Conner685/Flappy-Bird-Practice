# Flappy-Bird-Practice
This was a small project I did early in my game development career where I challenged myself to recreate a randomly selected game in a weekend!

It was a very good learning experience utilizing free online assets to try and create a simply yet well put together game in as short of a time as possible.

With my new found skills I plan to go back and retry my work in a new engine and much more efficiently manage my workflow instead of doing whatever felt right in the moment.
